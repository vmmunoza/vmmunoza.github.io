It may be easy to fool yourself when searching for something that it has never been seen before, such as a new fundamental particle or a new kind of force. I do spend a good amount of time thinking and searching for possible experimental signals of new physics, so Feynman's advice really comes in handy!

In this page I will comment on some of the interesting physics projects I have been involved.

## Searching a new neutrino type in cosmic-ray air showers

Did you know that the earth is constantly being bombarded by highly energetic particles comming from astrophysical sources?. Probably the most famous among these are the 
<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9gQLELtbhg'>
cosmic rays</a>, which are high-energy protons and atomic nuclei moving through space at almost the speed of light. Even though they have been studied for over a century it's origin remains unclear, but what we do know for certain is that when these cosmic rays hit the earth's atmosphere, they create an extensive shower of secondary particles with all kinds of particles such as neutrons, photons, charged mesons, neutrinos and muons among others. We know this because we have been measuring some of these particles in the surface of the earth and also in underground detectors for quite some time now.

An insteresting subject arises from asking about the possibility that some new, yet undiscovered, fundamental particle might be produced in atmospheric showers. Our understanding of which are the fundamental building blocks of matter and how do they interact with each other is summarized by the
<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehHoOYqAT_U'> 
Standard Model of Particle Physics</a> (SM). However, we know that the picture depicted by the SM is incomplete as it does not address several important facts; it doesn't explain why neutrinos are massive particles, it does not consider nor explain the existence of dark matter and it definetively does not account for the observation that we live in a universe made exclusively by matter and not antimatter.
</p>

<p align="justify">
There is a plethora of theories and possible new particles that are well motivated to complete the SM, among them,
<a href='https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/the-hidden-neutrino'> 
sterile neutrinos</a> are a very popular candidate because of its potential to address the Standard Model's shortcomings mentioned above. A simple extension of the SM (called 'νSM'), postulates the existence of three additional sterile neutrinos, so that the extended Standard Model would look like the image below

<p align="justify">
An important feature of sterile neutrinos is that they mix with ordinary neutrinos, which we know are produced copiously in atmospheric showers and that can be detected in giagantic underground experiments such as 
<a href='https://icecube.wisc.edu/'>
IceCube</a> or 
<a href='http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/index-e.html'>
Super-Kamiokande</a>. Because of this reason, it makes sence to expect that if sterile neutrinos do actually exist, then they might be produced in air showers as well and could also be detected in these big underground neutrino detectors.

## Detecting the collapse of a supermassive star

<img src="/img/SMS.png" alt="drawing"  width="500"/>

Hypothetical stellar objects possessing tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of times the mass of the Sun that could have arisen early in cosmic history. Supermassive stars are extreme versions of so-called Population III stars, the first stars that formed in the universe (Fig. 1). Researchers have proposed supermassive stars as the “seeds” for supermassive black holes, which developed inexplicably rapidly in the primordial universe, within a billion years of the Big Bang. These supermassive black holes powered extremely bright, young galaxies that we see in the distant universe as quasars, and have remained in the cores of galaxies through present day, including the Milky Way.


**[Here](https://github.com/vmmunoza/CosmicRays)** is a link to one of the projects where we search for these new types of neutrino in one of the largest underground neutrino detectors in the world, the Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector in Japan.
