- **Solutions to problems in Quantum Field Theory**  
<p align="justify">
<a href='https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/whatisqft.html'>
Quantum Field Theory</a>, is a beautiful tool used to describe how fundamental particles interact in our universe. Below you will find some solutions to a series of assignments I made in the past during a nice course of QFT at the University of SÃ£o Paulo.
