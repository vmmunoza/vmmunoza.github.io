I am a PhD candidate at the University of Valencia (Spain), and I'm working in the exciting field of elementary particle physics. I obtained my degree in physics at <i>PUC</i>, Chile, and then I did a Master's degree at <i>USP</i>, Brazil.

One of the things that intrigues me the most within my research field is the key role of neutrinos in our understanding of the universe, there is so much we can learn from them, specially when studyng them accompained of astrophysical observations. Nowadays, one of the most puzzling questions in particle physics is the origin of neutrino mass and I want to understand the possible connection that might exist between the physics that describes this, with the rest of evidence we have of the existence of new physics; the ubiquity of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the universe.

On the other hand, I am passionate about learning new things and I really enjoy training and improving the skills that are needed to perform great research in my field. Because of this I have developed a taste for several disciplines including mathematics, programming, data analysis, and  machine learning.

   <p> I'm a physics Ph.D. candidate at the University of Valencia (Spain), working in the exciting field of elementary particle physics. I obtained my degree in physics from PUC, Chile and then I did a Master degree at USP, Brazil. 
One of the things that intrigues me the most is the key role of neutrinos in our understanding of the universe, they are key for unvealing the next discoveries in particle physics. 

On the other hand, I also enjoy improving the skills that are are needed to perform world class research in this field, specially since they cover a wide range of possibilities, from theoretical mathematical modeling to programming software and data analysis.
