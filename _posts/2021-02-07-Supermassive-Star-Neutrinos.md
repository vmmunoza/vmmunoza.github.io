# Finally my paper which explores the possibility of detecting neutrinos from Supermassive Stars came to light!

We don't know if Supermassive Stars ever existed or not, but if so, they could be the seeds for Supermassive Black Holes.
We have shown in

<a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00885.pdf /'>this article</a>

that it could be possible to detect the neutrinos emitted from the collapse of these astrophysical objects.

you'll find a repository with a nice visualization of the temperature dependence of the neutrino spectrum generated from the historical collapse of Supermassive Stars
