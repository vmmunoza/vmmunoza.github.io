# Welcome to my personal website!

<p align="justify">
I am very happy to announce that finally, I have gathered some of the content I had sitting on my desktop and created this website where you can learn about my work. Enjoy reading the <i>Physics</i> and <i>Machine Learning</i> entries with links to projects hosted on GitHub!
</p> 

<p align="justify">
There is also a page with <i>Resources</i>, with different kinds of content that might be useful if you want to learn more about physics and machine learning.
</p>

Stay tuned as I will be adding new content and new resources very soon ;)
